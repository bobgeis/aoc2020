[This repo](https://github.com/bobgeis/aoc2020) contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) written in [nim](https://nim-lang.org/).

I probably won't have time to do all of the days. I definitely won't have time to do them all as they come out, but we'll see.

Generic setup. I haven't had time this year to learn a new programming language, so I'll be doing it in nim again.

I'm coding using vscode with [nim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kosz78.nim) and [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) extensions. Plus some others, but those two are nim-specific.

I've included 'lib' of code I found useful last year. `aocutils` has some utility procs for dealing with this particular repo (finding data files for each day, etc). `bedrock` is a misc utilities file that has requirement that it import nothing else from this repo. It's the "bottom". `vecna` is a bunch of convenience functions for working with vectors (eg: x,y[,z] coordinates) which happens a lot in aoc. It makes vectors of "N" values of "A" type. `graphwalk` is a very generic implementation of BFS and Djikstra's algorithm. Because I got tired of re-implementing them. `shenanigans` is for experimentation, weird macros, and causing trouble.

For nimble packages, the `stint` package is vital for dealing with very large ints. `memo` and `itertools` are sometimes very helpful and convenient.
